week-1:
We studied about how to represent mathematical objects in computers. 
Then we studied the basics of Graph Theory.
As assignments, we solved Ferrer diagram Problem, partition of sets problem and XOR sort problem.

Week-2:
**P and NP completeness problem**
P - Polynomial Time Solvable problem
  Why polyno mial time?
If a procedure is ef ficient, running it ' n' times is also efficient.
If I double the input size, time complexity gets multiplied by a constant, thus not affecting the asymptotic time complexity.
Any problem in P is also in NP.
**Easily Verifiable Proofs**
_**"Many problems which seemed hard have easily verifiable proofs for yes inputs."**_
This means that once we know a solution for a NP problem, we can verify it in Polynomial time.
Hence, a P problem can find solution in polynomial time but a NP problem can verify a solution in polynomial time. 
Hence a problem in P is also in NP.
Thus, we can say that P is a subset of NP.
The fact that many problems which seemed hard have easily verifiable proofs is an important property of NP -complete problems. This is because it means that even if we cannot find a polynomial time algorithm to solve NP - complete problems, we can still verify the solutions that we do find.
  **NP Completeness**
An NP - complete problem is a decision problem that is both in NP and NP - hard. This means that it is possible to verify a solution to the problem in polynomial time, and that any problem in NP can be reduced to the problem in polynomial time. For an NP complete problem X, X is in NP and every problem in NP reduces to X.
NP-complete problems are often very difficult to solve, and there is no known polynomial - time algorithm for any of them.

Week-3:
We will study about SAT solving.
