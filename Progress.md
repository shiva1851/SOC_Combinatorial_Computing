week-1:
We studied about how to represent mathematical objects in computers. 
Then we studied the basics of Graph Theory.
As assignments, we solved Ferrer diagram Problem, partition of sets problem and XOR sort problem.

Week-2:
We studied about backtracking and enumeration by exhaustive search.
For this, we started by basic terminologies in graph theory.
After that, we studied about time complexity of algorithms.
We also studied about basics of P, NP and completeness problem.
We also studied about Breadth First Search and Depth First Search.
As assignment, we solved a beautiful problem using graph theory.

Week-3:
We will study about SAT solving.
